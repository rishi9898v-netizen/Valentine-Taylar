                    <p>(a) When Valentine states "I'm not hungry" or "I don't want anything," Licensee shall nonetheless order or prepare sufficient food to share, as Valentine reserves the right to consume portions of Licensee's food without prior notice.</p>

                    <p>(d) Licensee shall not express displeasure, frustration, or annoyance when Valentine exercises these food-sharing rights, as such expressions shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.</p>

                    <p><strong>Section 6.03 - Culinary Adventure Clause.</strong> Licensee agrees to accompany Valentine in trying new restaurants, cuisines, and food establishments with an open mind and positive attitude, even if such establishments serve food outside of Licensee's normal preferences.</p>

                    <p>(c) <em>Music Selection:</em> While Licensee may have music preferences, Licensee agrees that Valentine shall have equal or greater authority in music selection during joint activities, car rides, and other shared listening experiences.</p>
                    <p>(d) <em>Dancing:</em> Licensee shall dance with Valentine upon request, regardless of Licensee's self-assessed dancing ability, comfort level, or presence of other persons.

                    <p><strong>Section 27.01 - Severability Clause.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

                    <h4>ARTICLE XXVIII: ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h4>
                    <p><strong>Section 28.01 - Complete Agreement.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, between the parties, except for any previous promises Licensee made to Valentine, which shall remain in effect.</p>

                    <p><strong>Section 29.01 - Electronic Acceptance.</strong> This Agreement may be executed by clicking the "I Accept" button below, which shall constitute a legally binding electronic signature with the same force and effect as a handwritten signature.</p>
                    
                    <h4>ARTICLE XXX: ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF READING AND UNDERSTANDING</h4>
                    <p><strong>Section 30.01 - Acknowledgment.</strong> By clicking "I Accept," Licensee acknowledges that:</p>
                    <p>(a) Licensee has carefully read and fully understands all terms and conditions of this Agreement;</p>
                    <p>(b) Licensee has had adequate opportunity to review this Agreement and ask questions;</p>
                    <p>(c) Licensee enters into this Agreement freely and voluntarily, without duress or coercion (except the coercion of Valentine being absolutely irresistible);</p>
                    <p>(d) Licensee agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions set forth herein;</p>
                    <p>(e) Licensee acknowledges that Valentine is amazing and this is the best decision Licensee has ever made.</p>

                    <p><strong>Section 31.02 - The Goodnight Kiss Mandate.</strong> Under no circumstances shall either party go to sleep without exchanging goodnight kisses, except in cases of illness, physical separation due to travel, or other force majeure events.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Section 31.03 - The Inside Jokes Amendment.</strong> The parties agree to develop and maintain an extensive repertoire of inside jokes that no one else will understand, thereby strengthening their bond and confusing their friends.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Section 31.04 - The Future Planning Provision.</strong> Licensee agrees to engage in discussions about future plans, dreams, and goals with Valentine, and to include Valentine in Licensee's vision of the future.</p>
                    
                    <h4>FINAL PROVISIONS</h4>
                    <p><strong>YOU HAVE NOW REACHED THE END OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>By scrolling to this point, you have demonstrated exceptional commitment and dedication (or at least the ability to scroll really fast). Congratulations!</p>
                    
                    <p>Please note that despite the humorous and exaggerated nature of many provisions in this Agreement, the underlying sentiment is genuine: this Relationship is built on mutual respect, love, care, and the understanding that we're both imperfect humans trying our best to make each other happy.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>IN WITNESS WHEREOF,</strong> you may now click the "I Accept" button below to formalize your acceptance of these terms and officially become my Valentine. No pressure though. (Okay, maybe a little pressure. I mean, you did click "YES" and scroll through this entire document, so...)</p>
